Student Performance Analysis

📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes students' academic performance using Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The dataset includes various attributes such as gender, parental education, test preparation, and study hours to understand their impact on student scores.

📂 Dataset Information
The dataset contains the following columns:
Gender - Male or Female
Ethnic Group - Categorical groups of students
Parent Education - Education level of students' parents
Lunch Type - Standard or free/reduced lunch
Test Preparation - Whether the student completed test prep
Number of Siblings - How many siblings the student has
Study Hours per Week - Weekly study hours category
Transport Means - How students commute to school
Math Score, Reading Score, Writing Score - Student performance scores

🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
Python 🐍
Pandas - Data cleaning & manipulation
NumPy - Numerical operations
Matplotlib & Seaborn - Data visualization

📊 Key Insights & Findings
✅ Students who study more hours tend to score higher.
✅ Parents' education level positively affects student performance.
✅ Marital status of parents has little effect on student scores.
✅ Students who completed test preparation performed better.
